# C-Projects

Summary: 
This program asked users for how many numbers they wanted to input then it asked for the specific numbers. Once the program received and outputed the numbers, it would ask the user if they wanted to run through the program again by replying with yes or no. The yes response put them back through the program and the no response closed the program. The program also has both an if statement and a trycatch exception to prevent the users from entering non-numeric input.
